#! /bin/bash

# This script installs the Sandstorm Personal Cloud Server on your Linux
# machine. You can run the latest installer directly from the web by doing:
#
#     curl https://install.sandstorm.io | bash
#
# Alternatively, if it makes you feel better, you can download and run the
# script:
#
#     wget https://install.sandstorm.io/install.sh
#     bash install.sh
#
# This script only modifies your system in the following ways:
# - Install Sandstorm into the directory you choose, typically /opt/sandstorm.
# - Optionally add an initscript to /etc/init.d/sandstorm.
# - Add commands "sandstorm" and "spk" to /usr/local/bin.
#
# The script will ask you whether you're OK with giving it root privileges.
# If you refuse, the script can still install Sandstorm (to a directory you
# own), but will not be able to install the initscript or shortcut commands,
# and the dev tools will not work (due to limitations with using FUSE in a
# sandbox).
#
# This script downloads an installs binaries. This means that to use this
# script, you need to trust that the authors are not evil, or you must use
# an isolated machine or VM. Of course, since the Sandstorm authors'
# identities are widely known, if they did try to do anything evil, you
# could easily get them arrested. That said, if you'd rather install from
# 100% auditable source code, please check out the Github repository instead.
#
# All downloads occur over HTTPS.
